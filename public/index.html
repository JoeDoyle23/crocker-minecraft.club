                The Crocker Minecraft Club is a private Minecraft server where members can learn to play Minecraft in a
                safe and protected place. Our goal is to help foster proper online etiquette when playing with others. Parents can
                read more about the Crocker Minecraft Club on the <a href="#for-parents">For Parents</a> section.

            <p>
                In order to have an environment where everyone can have fun, there are a few simple rules for this server.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Be nice to other players</li>
                <li>Do not destroy another player's property</li>
                <li>No stealing from other players</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Players who don't follow the rules will lose access to the server.

                Minecraft can be a fun way for kids to start learning about computers. The hard part can be understanding how to start!
                This server is setup to allow the Crocker community to learn to play Minecraft with their friends. To help you understand 
                how all this works, here are some answers to common questions.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>What do we need to join the server?</b><br/>
                    You will need to own a copy of Minecraft that runs on a PC, Mac, or Linux.
                </li>
                <li><b>Can I play with Minecraft Pocket Edition? (On Android, iPhone, iPad, Xbox)</b><br/>
                    Minecraft Pocket Edition is a different version of Minecraft designed for mobile devices.
                    It's not actually the full version of Minecraft, and is unable to connect to this server.
                </li>
                <li><b>How much does it cost to play?</b><br/>
                    Playing on the server is free. You do need to own a copy of Minecraft. You can purchase it at <a href="https://minecraft.net/en-us/" target="_blank">minecraft.net</a>
                </li>
                <li><b>What is different when playing on a server compared to playing alone?</b><br/>
                    This server is setup to be the same as when playing in Single Player, except players can work together. The Nether and The End dimensions are enabled (you might need
                    to ask your kids to explain that to you!)
                </li>
                <li><b>What is the game mode? Are there cheats enabled?</b><br/>
                    This server is running in Survival Mode. There are no cheats enabled.
                </li>
                <li><b>I like Minecraft! Can I play too?</b><br/>
                    Sure! No reason parent's can't play too.
                </li>
                <li><b>How do we get started?</b><br/>
                    Initially, the server will be by invite only. After I get a feeling for how everything is working, we'll open it up to the broader Crocker Community.
                </li>
